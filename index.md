# Welcome to **Mimic +** & **Mimic + Lite**

Mimic + is an addictive and challenging memory game based on Simon Says classic game - one of the most popular games of all time!

Have a few minutes to spare? Waiting in line? This is perfect for you!

The concept is simple: repeat the color sequence shown—with each round, one more step is added. Sounds easy?
The challenge ramps up fast. Try it and see how far your memory can take you!

Don’t be fooled by its simplicity. Reach level 30 and you’re a true genius
